This feature creates the ability for a subscription offer to be included in the URL, and then the offer will be cookied and added to the user\'s cart. Combined Checkout is a powerful tool for Bluprint to acquire new subscribers, and presenting offers to users that are already purchasing products during times of high traffic is a crucial revenue driver to Bluprint\'s subscription business.',

The solution we came up with was to scrape the navigation built with CMS-driven code and pull it in via AJAX to pages built with our React stack. The main benefit of this approach is that it allows the navigation bar to be fully configureable via the CMS, and those changes will carry over to React-driven pages. The integration allowed for stateful communication between the two apps.',

This feature was part of a larger epic of improvements made to modules around the site that directly tie to the video watching experience. We also track clicks and deletions made by users. This data informs the business on which classes our users choose to not continue watching, which leads to more informed descision making and content creation.',

On the CMS side, product data is provided by the back end, and the page editor is able to input products themselves and populate data fields. These product placements help improve ecommerce revenue numbers and bring together the two sides of Bluprint's product.</p>,

The students made portfolio sites along the way and completed coding exercises. As a result of delivering an impactful course, the Client Services team internally hired three out of six participants after completion of their coding education.</p>,
