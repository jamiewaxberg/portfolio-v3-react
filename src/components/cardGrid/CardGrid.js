The solution we came up with was to scrape the navigation from the CMS stack and pull it in via AJAX to our React stack. The main benefit of this approach was that it allowed the navigation bar to be fully configureable via the CMS, and those changes carried over to the React stack. The integration allowed for stateful communication between the two apps.',

On the CMS side, product data is provided by the back end, and the article creator is able to input products themselves instead of just links. These product placements help improve ecommerce revenue numbers and bring together the two sides of Bluprint's product.</p>,

The students made portfolio sites along the way and completed coding exercises. As a result of delivering an impactful course, the Client Services team internally hired three out of six participants after completion of their coding education.</p>,
